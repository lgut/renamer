# Renamer

A CLI application for bulk renaming files by prepending a random character string to their name. This project replaces a bash script written to accomplish the same purpose

## Problem this solves for me

When I take pictures with my camera, I'll set it up so that different photo taking sessions have their own folder.
This leads to the camera generating a lot of files and folders with the same name across different shoots.

This program allows me to rename this files with a unique name while also preserving the order in which the photos were taken.

It's also an opportunity to explore the Rust language.
